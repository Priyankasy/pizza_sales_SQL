# Pizza Sales Management System (SQL-based)

This project is a database-driven system designed to manage and track pizza sales efficiently using SQL. It enables pizza restaurants or businesses to keep track of their sales transactions, customer orders, inventory, and financial data with ease. By leveraging SQL databases, this project focuses on providing a reliable and scalable solution for managing pizza sales.

### Key Features:
- **Sales Tracking**: Store and query sales data, including pizza types, order quantities, and total sales.
- **Customer Management**: Maintain a customer database with contact details and order history, enabling personalized services.
- **Inventory Tracking**: Track ingredient stock levels and usage, making it easier to reorder supplies based on sales trends.
- **Reports and Analytics**: Generate detailed reports on sales performance, popular pizzas, and revenue over specific time periods (daily, weekly, monthly).
- **Order History**: Maintain an order history table for easy tracking of completed or canceled orders.

### Technologies Used:
- **Database**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite for storing all the data related to sales, customers, inventory, and orders.
- **SQL Queries**: Use SQL to insert, update, delete, and select data from the database. Implement complex queries for generating reports and managing relationships between tables.
- **Data Modeling**: Design the database schema with tables such as `Customers`, `Orders`, `Pizzas`, `Ingredients`, and `Sales`.

### Database Schema:
- **Customers Table**: Contains customer information (e.g., name, contact details, loyalty status).
- **Pizzas Table**: Contains details of available pizzas (e.g., pizza name, ingredients, price).
- **Orders Table**: Stores order information (e.g., order date, customer ID, pizza IDs, quantity, total price).
- **Ingredients Table**: Tracks ingredients used for pizzas (e.g., tomato sauce, cheese, toppings) and their stock levels.
- **Sales Table**: Records completed transactions, linking order IDs with payment status and revenue.

### Sample SQL Queries:
- **Tracking Sales**:
  ```sql
  SELECT pizza_name, SUM(quantity) AS total_sold
  FROM orders
  JOIN pizzas ON orders.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id
  GROUP BY pizza_name;
  ```
- **Customer Order History**:
  ```sql
  SELECT customer_name, order_date, pizza_name, quantity, total_price
  FROM orders
  JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
  JOIN pizzas ON orders.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id
  WHERE customers.customer_id = 101;
  ```

### Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up your SQL database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite).
3. Import the schema and sample data (included in the project).
4. Use the SQL queries to manage orders, track sales, and analyze performance.

### Benefits of the Project:
- **Efficient Data Management**: Use SQL to organize, store, and retrieve sales and customer data quickly.
- **Scalable**: Easily expand the database as the pizza business grows, adding more features like delivery tracking or promotions.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Generate sales reports and analyze customer preferences to optimize menu offerings and improve sales strategies.
